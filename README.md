# Learning-Path-Computer-Science
A practical introduction to algorithms and data structures and computer science topics in JavaScript.

## Core Coursework (take these in order)

1. [Four Semesters of Computer Science in 5 Hours](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/computer-science/) : Start with a tour of the main computer science concepts including big-o to measure code complexity, algorithms to search and sort and data structures to store and retrieve data efficiently, and basic functional programming.

2. [A Practical Guide to Algorithms with JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/) : Dive into the most common algorithms in computer science using JavaScript.

3. [Introduction to Data Structures for Interviews](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/data-structures-interviews/) : Master the most common data structures in computer science asked for in job interviews.

4. [Four Semesters of Computer Science in 5 Hours, Part 2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/computer-science-2/) : In part 2 of Brian’s series, you’ll learn many more computer science concepts that tripped Brian up in big company interviews. He’ll teach you to traverse graphs, generate mazes with code, and more!

5. [Tree and Graph Data Structures](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/trees-and-graphs/) : Trees and graphs are non-linear data structures, which allows for modeling things such as recommendation algorithms and social networks.
